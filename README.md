To Get You Started
--------
This project uses [makefiles](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) to automate the common workflows within the pipeline

To get started with this project install [make](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/make-install.html), then type `make` in your terminal. This will list available commands

Then type `make create_environment`, `make requirements` and finally `make test_environment` to verify the setup.
